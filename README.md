The dataset includes:  
- 📊 Opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices of indices.  
- 📈 Trading volumes over the selected periods.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- 🔄 Standardization of formats (e.g., datetime for dates, float for financial values).  
- 🗂️ Addition of a **Mandate** column to classify data into:  
  - Obama (2013)  
  - Trump 1 (2017)
